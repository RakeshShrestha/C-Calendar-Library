Calendrical calculation library, Gnu llvm compiler and Windows 10 1903 SDK

## Requirements
- Install Clang-gnu 
- Codeblocks IDE is very good IDE for C/C++ download from https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/
## OR
- Install LLVM >= 11.0.0 and add it to your path from https://releases.llvm.org/download.html -- requires space 1.6 gb
- Install Windows 10 1903 SDK to  C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\References\10.0.18362.0 from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/  -- requires 2.6 gb space very huge but very less than visual studio 2019 community edition

## Build from command line, using clang
Run ```build.bat```

## Build from command line, using clang with MSVC frontend
Run ```build-with-clang-via-msvc-frontend.bat```

I personally consider even installation only of window 10 sdk is huge
