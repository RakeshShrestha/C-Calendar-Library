Calendrical calculation library

## Requirements
- Install LLVM >= 9.0.0 and add it to your path
- Install Windows 10 1903 SDK to  C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\References\10.0.18362.0

## Build from command line, using clang
Run ```build.bat```

## Build from command line, using clang with MSVC frontend
Run ```build-with-clang-via-msvc-frontend.bat```

I personally consider even installation ony of window 10 sdk is huge
